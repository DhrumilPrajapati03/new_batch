'''The random-access memory is volatile, and all its contents are lost once a program 
terminates. In order to persist the data forever, we use files. 

A file is data stored in a storage device. A python program can talk to the file by reading 
content from it and writing content to it. '''

#Steps for File Handling in Python: 
# • Opening a file  
# • Reading from a file - r 
# • Writing to a file - w (write mode) and a (append mode)
# • Closing the file 

# Syntax for opening a file:
# open("filename", "mode of opening(read mode by default)") 
f = open("File-IO\\hello.txt", "r") 
text = f.read() 
print(text)

text = f.readline()
print(text)
f.close()

f = open("new.txt", "a")
f.write("Hello, Good evening\n")
f.close()

# 1 Write a program to read the text from a given file ‘poems.txt’ 
# 2 Write a program to write the text “Hello, Good evening” to a file named ‘greeting.txt’
# 3 Write a program to append the text “Have a nice day” to the file ‘greeting.txt’
